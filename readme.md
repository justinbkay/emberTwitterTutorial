Introduction
============

This is an attempt to get the tutorial code to work with the updated ember library.  Version 1.0-pre
at the time of this writing.  The tutorial is located here: http://return-true.com/2012/05/getting-started-with-emberjs/

When I initially attempted to make the code run with the most current libraries I was getting some errors.  I
got the errors resolved and implemented the controller changes suggested by Trek on twitter.

I know that this code isn't really very good ember code, there is no use of a state manager, and I couldn't get the view
bindings to the controller to work, but it does function in the current state.
