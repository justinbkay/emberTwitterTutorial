Introduction
============

This is an attempt to get the code from this [tutorial](http://return-true.com/2012/05/getting-started-with-emberjs) to work with the 
updated [ember.js](http://emberjs.com) library (Version 1.0-pre at the time of this writing).

Initially when I attempted to run the code with the most current libraries I was getting some errors.  I
got the errors resolved and implemented the controller changes suggested by Trek on twitter.

I know this code isn't very good ember code, there is no use of a state manager, and I couldn't get the view
bindings to the controller to work, but it does function in its current state.
